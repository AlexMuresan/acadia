## Workshop Resources and Introduction
(TODO - collate key tutorial resources)
E.g. broad overview of machine learning [Machine Learning Is Fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471):
(TODO - setup learning materials folder on git)
E.g. Refer to [Reference Material](#Reference) for more resources.

## Workshop Setup

### Spinning up a Deep Learning Instance
- Log in to RMIT-ACADIA Amazon EC2 account using (TODO - setup account)
- Create a new instance using image (TODO - our image)

### SSH into your instance
- Mac users
- Windows users

### Get the code
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gwyllo/acadia
cd acadia
```

Please refer to [Model Zoo](#Pre-trained-models) for more pre-trained models.
`./examples/test_vangogh_style_on_ae_photos.sh` is an example script that downloads the pretrained Van Gogh style network and runs it on Efros's photos.
