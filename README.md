ACADIA machine learning workshop code and resources

## Workshop Resources and Introduction
(TODO - collate key tutorial resources)
E.g. broad overview of machine learning [Machine Learning Is Fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471):
(TODO - setup learning materials folder on git)
E.g. Refer to [Reference Material](/Reference/reference.md) for more resources.

## Workshop Setup

### Spinning up a Deep Learning Instance
- Log in to RMIT-ACADIA Amazon EC2 account using (TODO - setup account w/ $2000 rmit funds)
- Create a new instance using image (TODO - our image)

### SSH into your instance
- Mac users
- Windows users

### Get the code
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gwyllo/acadia
cd acadia
```

### Software
- Notepad ++
- WinSCP?
- Jupyter notebook?
- tensorboard?
- screen

## Models

### NeuralStyle
- train a basic model

### StackGAN
- get basic text to image working

### pix2pix
- train two models and get them to feedback
- generating datasets in GH

### cycleGAN
- train two models and get them to feedback
- generating datasets in GH

### torchRNN
